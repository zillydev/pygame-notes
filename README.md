# Pygame Notes

This repo contains pygame notes as reference for creating games. It contains tutorials for multiple concepts with well commented codes, as well as examples for a few simple games.

Each tutorial has two types of files - normal and `nc` (no-comments) labeled. The normal file contains code with explanation of each new line covered, while the `nc`-labeled file contains only code, useful for reusing.

The example games' entry point is `game.py`, located in the root directory or `scripts` directory.
